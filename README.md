# Early-Detection-and-Treatment-Simulation-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Using-CNN-and-Reinforcement-Learning
This project presents an integrated machine learning approach for the early diagnosis and treatment simulation of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using medical imaging and reinforcement learning.

# 🚀 Project Overview
We utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into four stages of Alzheimer's Disease:
Cognitively Normal (CN)
Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI)
Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI)
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
Once classified, a Q-learning-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent recommends optimal treatment strategies to delay disease progression through intelligent decision-making.

# 📁 Dataset
MRI brain scan data sourced from:
-Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
-Kaggle Alzheimer’s MRI Datasets

# Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)

# 🎯 Outcomes
CNN model achieved high accuracy in stage-wise classification of Alzheimer’s from MRI scans.
Q-learning agent learned a treatment policy that maximizes the reward by delaying disease progression.
Combined pipeline offers both diagnostic insights and intelligent treatment guidance.
